\chapter{Preface}
\label{ch:preface}
This master research is done for \furl{hostnet} from Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Hostnet is a hosting provider active since 1999 and offers domain names in almost all available top level domain names, shared hosting, virtual private and dedicated server hosting. The company has about 165,000 customers and sold approximately 600,000 domain names. Currently Hostnet is the no. 1 seller of the Dutch .nl domains.

Hostnet has it's own software engineering department which takes care of developing all internal systems for the provision of the sold domains and hosing as well as the customer relation management, the web store and web site. All the graphic design is done by the design department. \furl{php} is used to build these complex web applications. Within the company the need rose to delete old program code from the application to make it easier to maintain and upgrade the software, reducing the total cost of ownership. 

I would like to thank the members of the Hostnet software Engineering team for their cooperation and open attitude towards the project and H.-G. Gross for his counselling and pleasant collaboration. Also a word of gratitude for my lovely girlfriend who had to practice a lot of patience when I was working on my thesis and had little time. Last but not least I want to thank my parents for their support and caring.
